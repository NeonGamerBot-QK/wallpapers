## My wallpapers!!
all epic wallpapers here (just repos)
you can get them all by running `node extract_into_a_dir.js` which while grab `~6gb` of wallpapers
this repo uses submodules because its easier then storing a bunch of images :P.
to pick which walls you want you can also choose which submodule you want to pull :P.
